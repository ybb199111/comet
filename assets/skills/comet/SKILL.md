# Comet — OpenSpec + Superpowers Dual-Star Development Workflow

OpenSpec and Superpowers orbit the same goal like a binary star system. OpenSpec handles WHAT, Superpowers handles HOW.

```
OpenSpec handles WHAT  — outline, proposal, spec lifecycle, archive
Superpowers handles HOW — technical design, planning, execution, closing
```

**Core principle: brainstorming cannot be skipped. Every change must undergo deep design (except hotfix and tweak presets).**

## Decision Core

Agents need only read this section for decision-making. Refer to the Reference Appendix as needed.

### Automatic Phase Detection

**Step 0: Active Change Discovery**

1. Run `openspec list --json` to get all active changes

| Active changes | User input | Behavior |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| None | any | → Invoke `/comet-open` |
| Exactly 1 | `/comet <description>` | → **Ask**: continue this change or create a new change |
| Multiple | `/comet <description>` | → **Ask**: continue existing or create new; if continuing, list changes for selection |
| Exactly 1 | `/comet` with no description | → Auto-select, enter Step 1 |
| Multiple | `/comet` with no description | → List changes for user selection |

<IMPORTANT>
When the user chooses "create a new change", **must invoke `/comet-open`**. Do not call `/opsx:new` directly.
`/comet-open` performs dual initialization: OpenSpec artifacts plus `.comet.yaml` state.
Calling `/opsx:new` directly leaves `.comet.yaml` missing and breaks later phase detection.
</IMPORTANT>

**Preset detection**:
- User describes as bug fix / hotfix + meets hotfix conditions → directly invoke `/comet-hotfix`
- User describes as copy, config, docs, prompt or small non-bug adjustment + meets tweak conditions → directly invoke `/comet-tweak`

**Step 1: Read `.comet.yaml` state metadata**

Prefer reading `openspec/changes/<name>/.comet.yaml`. If not available, fall back to `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`, `tasks.md`, and `docs/superpowers/` file checks.

**Resume rules**:
- On every context resume, rerun Step 0 and Step 1; do not trust conversation history for phase detection
- If `phase: build`, read the next unchecked task from tasks.md and continue
- If `phase: verify` and `verify_result: fail`, first run `bash "$COMET_STATE" transition <name> verify-fail`, then invoke `/comet-build`
- If `phase: open` but proposal/design/tasks are complete, run `bash "$COMET_GUARD" <change-name> open --apply` to repair state, then continue detection
- If `phase: archive`, only invoke `/comet-archive`; after archive succeeds, the change moves to the archive directory, so do not run guard against the old active directory

**Step 2: Phase Determination** (check in order, first match wins)

1. `archived: true` or change moved to archive → Workflow complete
2. `verify_result: pass` and `archived` is not `true` → Invoke `/comet-archive`
3. `verify_result: fail` → run `bash "$COMET_STATE" transition <name> verify-fail`, then invoke `/comet-build`
4. `phase: verify` or tasks.md all checked → Invoke `/comet-verify`
5. `phase: build` or has Design Doc but plan/execution incomplete → Invoke `/comet-build`
6. `phase: design` or has change but no Design Doc → Invoke `/comet-design`
7. `phase: open` or active change exists but `.comet.yaml` is missing → Invoke `/comet-open`
8. No active change → Invoke `/comet-open`

If metadata conflicts with file state, use verifiable file state as source of truth and correct `.comet.yaml` before continuing.

### Preset Upgrade Criteria

**hotfix → full** (upgrade if any condition met):
- Change involves **3+ files**
- Architecture changes (new modules, new interfaces, new dependencies)
- Database schema changes
- Fix introduces new public API
- Fix scope exceeds a single function/module

**tweak → full** (upgrade if any condition met):
- Change involves **5+ files**
- Cross-module coordination required
- **5+** new test cases needed
- Config item additions or deletions (not value changes)

### Error Handling Quick Reference

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| `openspec list --json` fails | Check if openspec is installed, prompt user to run `openspec init` |
| Sub-skill unavailable | Stop workflow, prompt to install or enable the corresponding skill |
| `.comet.yaml` malformed or missing | Use file state as source of truth, correct with `bash $COMET_STATE set` then continue |
| Build/test fails | Return to build phase for fixes, do not enter verify |
| Incomplete change directory structure | Fill missing files according to `comet-open` artifact requirements |

### Phase Transitions

<IMPORTANT>
A single `/comet` invocation starts from the detected phase and advances to the next phase when exit conditions are met.

Flow chain: open → design → build → verify → archive

**Continuous execution requirement**: starting from the detected phase, the agent must automatically continue through all later phases without waiting for another user command, except at explicit decision points. After a phase completes, immediately enter the next phase.

Nodes requiring user participation:
1. Confirm design approach during brainstorming
2. Select execution mode during build phase
3. Decide to fix or accept deviation when verify fails
4. Choose branch handling method for finishing-branch
5. Encounter upgrade conditions (hotfix/tweak → full workflow)

Agents should not skip these decision points; other unambiguous phase transitions can proceed automatically.
</IMPORTANT>

## Reference Appendix

### .comet.yaml Field Reference

```yaml
workflow: full
phase: build
design_doc: docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-design.md
plan: docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature.md
build_mode: subagent-driven-development
isolation: branch
verify_mode: light
verify_result: pending
verification_report: null
branch_status: pending
verified_at: null
archived: false
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `workflow` | `full`, `hotfix`, or `tweak` |
| `phase` | Current phase: `open`, `design`, `build`, `verify`, `archive` |
| `design_doc` | Associated Superpowers Design Doc path, can be empty |
| `plan` | Associated Superpowers Plan path, can be empty |
| `build_mode` | Selected execution mode, can be empty |
| `isolation` | `branch` or `worktree`, workspace isolation method. Full workflow init may leave this as `null`, but only until `/comet-build` Step 3; hotfix/tweak default to `branch` |
| `verify_mode` | `light` or `full`, can be empty |
| `verify_result` | `pending`, `pass`, or `fail` |
| `verification_report` | Verification report file path; must point to an existing file before verify can pass |
| `branch_status` | `pending` or `handled`; set to `handled` after branch handling completes |
| `verified_at` | Verification pass time, can be empty |
| `archived` | Whether change is archived |

Optional fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `direct_override` | `true`/`false`. Full workflow may use `build_mode: direct` only when this is explicitly `true` |
| `build_command` | Project build command. Guard runs this first and prints failure output |
| `verify_command` | Project verification command. Verify guard runs this first; if absent, it falls back to the build command |

State-machine hard constraints:
- Before `build → verify`, `isolation` must be `branch` or `worktree`
- Before `build → verify`, `build_mode` must be selected
- `build_mode: direct` is allowed by default only for `hotfix` / `tweak`; full workflow requires `direct_override: true`
- These constraints are enforced by both `comet-guard.sh build --apply` and `comet-state.sh transition <name> build-complete`

### Script Location

Comet scripts are distributed in `comet/scripts/`. **Do not hardcode paths** — locate once, cache in env vars:

```bash
COMET_SEARCH_ROOTS=("." "$HOME/.claude/skills" "$HOME/.codex/skills" "$HOME/.cursor/skills")
COMET_GUARD="${COMET_GUARD:-$(find "${COMET_SEARCH_ROOTS[@]}" -path '*/comet/scripts/comet-guard.sh' -type f -print -quit 2>/dev/null)}"
COMET_STATE="${COMET_STATE:-$(find "${COMET_SEARCH_ROOTS[@]}" -path '*/comet/scripts/comet-state.sh' -type f -print -quit 2>/dev/null)}"
COMET_ARCHIVE="${COMET_ARCHIVE:-$(find "${COMET_SEARCH_ROOTS[@]}" -path '*/comet/scripts/comet-archive.sh' -type f -print -quit 2>/dev/null)}"

if [ -z "$COMET_GUARD" ] || [ -z "$COMET_STATE" ] || [ -z "$COMET_ARCHIVE" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Comet scripts not found. Ensure the comet skill is installed." >&2
  echo "Expected path pattern: */comet/scripts/comet-*.sh under project or platform skill directories" >&2
  return 1
fi
```

**Auto state update**: Guard supports `--apply` flag, automatically updating `.comet.yaml` state fields after checks pass:

```bash
bash "$COMET_GUARD" <change-name> <phase> --apply
```

`--apply` delegates to `comet-state transition`. Use these semantic events when state changes need to be expressed directly:

```bash
bash "$COMET_STATE" transition <change-name> open-complete
bash "$COMET_STATE" transition <change-name> design-complete
bash "$COMET_STATE" transition <change-name> build-complete
bash "$COMET_STATE" transition <change-name> verify-pass
bash "$COMET_STATE" transition <change-name> verify-fail
bash "$COMET_STATE" transition <archive-name> archived
```

**Archive script**: Complete all archive steps in one command:

```bash
bash "$COMET_ARCHIVE" <change-name>
```

After loading comet, agents should run the three variable assignments above once, then reuse `$COMET_GUARD`, `$COMET_STATE`, `$COMET_ARCHIVE` throughout the session.

### Best Practices

1. **brainstorming cannot be skipped** — Every change must undergo deep design (except hotfix and tweak)
2. **delta spec is a living document** — Freely modify during phase 3, sync at archive
3. **Keep tasks.md in sync** — Check off each completed task
4. **Commit frequently** — One commit per task, message reflects design intent
5. **Verify before archive** — Execute `/comet-archive` only after `/comet-verify` passes
6. **Classify incremental updates** — Small edits, medium brainstorming, large new changes
7. **Plan must associate with change** — File header contains `change:` and `design-doc:` metadata
8. **Archive closure** — design doc and plan must mark `archived-with` status
9. **Modifying existing features** — Just open a new change
10. **Preset has limits** — Switch to full workflow promptly when hotfix/tweak meet upgrade conditions
