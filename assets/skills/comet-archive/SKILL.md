# Comet Phase 5: Archive (Archive)

## Prerequisites

- Verification passed (Phase 4 complete)
- Branch handled
- `verify_result: pass` in `openspec/changes/<name>/.comet.yaml`

## Steps

### 0. Entry State Verification (Entry Check)

Execute entry verification:

```bash
COMET_SEARCH_ROOTS=("." "$HOME/.claude/skills" "$HOME/.codex/skills" "$HOME/.cursor/skills")
COMET_STATE="${COMET_STATE:-$(find "${COMET_SEARCH_ROOTS[@]}" -path '*/comet/scripts/comet-state.sh' -type f -print -quit 2>/dev/null)}"
bash "$COMET_STATE" check <name> archive
```

Proceed to Step 1 after verification passes. The script outputs specific failure reasons when verification fails.

### 1. Execute Archive

Run the archive script to automatically complete all steps:

```bash
bash "$COMET_ARCHIVE" "<change-name>"
```

The script automatically executes:
1. Entry state validation (phase=archive, verify_result=pass, archived=false)
2. Delta spec sync to main spec (overwrite)
3. Design doc frontmatter annotation (archived-with, status)
4. Plan frontmatter annotation (archived-with)
5. Move change to archive directory
6. Update `archived: true` through `comet-state transition <archive-name> archived`

If script returns non-zero exit code, report error and stop.
If script returns zero exit code, archive is complete.
The summary `X/Y steps succeeded` counts real executed steps and does not double-count delta spec sync or document annotation.

When a delta spec differs from an existing main spec, the script prints a unified diff before overwrite so the archive sync content is visible.

Use `--dry-run` flag to preview without executing.

### 2. Lifecycle Closed Loop

Spec lifecycle completes here:
```
brainstorming → delta spec → implementation → verification → main spec overwrite → design doc annotation → archive
```

## Exit Conditions

- Archive script executed successfully (exit code 0)
- Archive directory `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<change-name>/` exists
- Archived `.comet.yaml` contains `archived: true`

The archive script moves `openspec/changes/<name>/` to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/`. After successful archive, do not run `bash "$COMET_GUARD" <change-name> archive` against the old active change name; the active directory no longer exists. Archive completeness is determined by the script exit code and archived directory state.

## Complete

Comet workflow complete. To start new work, invoke `/comet` or `/comet-open`.
