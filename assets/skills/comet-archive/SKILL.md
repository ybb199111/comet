# Comet Phase 5: Archive (Archive)

## Prerequisites

- Verification passed (Phase 4 complete)
- Archive commit and branch handling are still pending (`branch_status: pending`)
- `verify_result: pass` in `openspec/changes/<name>/.comet.yaml`

## Steps

### 0. Output Language Constraint

Archive summaries and lifecycle closure notes must use the configured Comet artifact language from `comet state get <name> language`.

### 0. Entry State Verification (Entry Check)

Use the stable `comet` CLI described in `comet/reference/scripts.md`, then run entry verification. When resuming from any entry point, first run the recovery check in `comet/reference/context-recovery.md`:

```bash
comet state select <change-name>
comet state check <name> archive
```

Proceed to Step 1 after verification passes. The script outputs specific failure reasons when verification fails.

If the `select` / `check` output is `BLOCKED` because `bound_branch` does not match the current branch, immediately pause under `comet/reference/decision-point.md` and let the user choose one option: switch back to the bound branch and rerun entry verification, or run `comet state rebind <change-name>` after the user explicitly confirms the current branch should take over this change, then rerun entry verification. Do not switch branches or rebind on your own.

### 1. Final Archive Confirmation (Blocking Point)

After entry verification passes, **must follow the `comet/reference/decision-point.md` protocol to pause and wait for the user to confirm whether to archive immediately**. Must not run `comet archive "<change-name>"` before user confirmation.

Before confirmation, show the user a brief summary:
- Change name
- Verification report path and result
- Current branch/workspace and attribution summary for pre-existing dirty changes
- Irreversible actions this archive will perform: merge main specs with OpenSpec delta semantics, annotate design doc / plan, and move the change to the archive directory

The user confirmation question must be presented as a single-select question with these options:
- "Confirm archive" — record the final confirmation state, then run the archive script to complete spec merge and change movement
- "Needs adjustment or re-verification" — do not archive; run `comet state transition <change-name> archive-reopen` to return to `phase: verify`, then invoke `/comet-verify`. If verification confirms fixes are needed, follow `/comet-verify`'s verification-failure decision flow back to `/comet-build`
- "Do not archive yet" — do not archive; keep the current `phase: archive` state and wait for the user to invoke `/comet-archive` again later

After the user selects "Confirm archive", immediately run:

```bash
comet state transition <change-name> archive-confirm
```

If the transition returns a non-zero exit code, report the error and stop. Only after the transition succeeds may Step 2 continue. After the user selects "Needs adjustment or re-verification", must first run the `archive-reopen` state transition; do not edit `.comet.yaml` manually.

### 2. Execute Archive

Run the archive script:

```bash
comet archive "<change-name>"
```

The script automatically executes:
1. Entry state validation (phase=archive, verify_result=pass, archive_confirmation=confirmed, archived=false)
2. Design doc frontmatter annotation (archived-with, status)
3. Plan frontmatter annotation (archived-with)
4. OpenSpec archive for delta-merge semantics and moving the change to the archive directory
5. Main spec guard against leaked delta-only section headings
6. Update archived state in the actual OpenSpec archive directory and reconcile pending recovery metadata

If script returns non-zero exit code, report error and stop.
If script returns zero exit code, archive is complete.

The summary `X/Y steps succeeded` counts real executed steps and does not double-count delta spec sync or document annotation.

The script calls OpenSpec archive to merge `ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED` delta semantics into main specs, then verifies main specs do not contain delta-only section headings.

Use `--dry-run` flag to preview without executing.

### 3. Lifecycle Closed Loop

Spec lifecycle completes here:
```
brainstorming → delta spec → implementation → verification → main spec merge → design doc annotation → archive
```

### 4. Commit Archive Changes with Exact Paths

The archive script only moves files and merges the spec; it does not commit. After archiving, the worktree holds these uncommitted changes:
- The change directory moved from `openspec/changes/<name>/` to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/`
- The main spec content merged via delta semantics
- Archive metadata annotations on the design doc / plan

After archive, read `git status --short` and compare it with the pre-archive dirty-worktree attribution baseline. Stage only paths attributable to this change: the original active path, actual archive path printed by the command, main specs changed by this delta, and archive metadata on this Design Doc/Plan. Stop if any path cannot be attributed.

Use explicit pathspecs, then inspect the staged diff. Never stage the whole repository or mix the user's pre-existing changes into the archive commit:

```bash
git add -- <individually verified archive paths...>
git diff --cached --stat
git commit -m "chore: archive <change-name>"
```

Stop if the commit fails or the staged diff contains unrelated paths.

### 5. Handle the Branch After the Archive Commit

After the archive commit succeeds, first read `comet state get <change-name> isolation` and route by isolation:

- `isolation !== current`: **immediately execute:** use the Skill tool to load Superpowers `finishing-a-development-branch`. This ordering ensures the final branch or PR contains the main-spec merge and archive metadata. If the skill is unavailable, stop and prompt the user to enable/install it; do not mark `branch_status` handled. After loading it, pause under `comet/reference/decision-point.md` and let the user choose: merge locally into the main branch, push and create a PR, or keep the current branch for later.
- `isolation === current`: skip Superpowers `finishing-a-development-branch`. Pause under `comet/reference/decision-point.md` and let the user choose one option: push the current branch, or do not push yet and keep the local state.

Archive is already complete, so do not offer "discard work". Only after the selected operation succeeds, the user explicitly keeps the branch, or the user explicitly chooses not to push in `current` mode, run:

```bash
comet state set <change-name> branch_status handled
comet guard <change-name> archive
```

The archive guard must verify both archive completeness and `branch_status: handled`; a failure means the workflow is still incomplete.

## Exit Conditions

- Archive script executed successfully (exit code 0)
- Archive directory `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<change-name>/` exists
- Archived `.comet.yaml` contains `archived: true`
- Archive changes were committed with exact pathspecs
- The user's branch decision completed and archived state has `branch_status: handled`
- `comet guard <change-name> archive` passes

The archive script moves `openspec/changes/<name>/` to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/`.

`comet guard <change-name> archive` resolves the actual archive directory from the original change name; do not construct a dated archive path manually.

## Complete

Comet Classic workflow complete. To start new Classic work, invoke `/comet-classic` or `/comet-open`.

## Context Compression Recovery

Follow `comet/reference/context-recovery.md` with phase set to `archive`. If `archived: true` and archive directory exists, archival is complete — do not re-execute archive operations.
