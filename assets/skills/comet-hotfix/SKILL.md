# Comet Preset Path: Hotfix

Quick bug fix workflow: open → build → verify → archive. Skip brainstorming and full plan, applicable for behavior fixes not involving new capability design.

**Applicable conditions** (all must be met):
1. Fix bugs in existing functionality, no new capability
2. No interface changes or architecture adjustments
3. Change scope is predictable (file count is a hint only, not a hard upgrade condition; see Upgrade Assessment below)

**Not applicable**: If the fix process hits a qualitative-change signal (see "Upgrade Assessment" section), the user decides whether to upgrade to the full `/comet-classic` workflow.

---

## Process (preset workflow, 6 steps)

### 0. Output Language Constraint

Streamlined OpenSpec artifacts must use the configured Comet artifact language. Before `.comet.yaml` exists, read `classic.language` from project `.comet/config.yaml`, then fall back to global `~/.comet/config.yaml`; after initialization, use `comet state get <name> language`.

Execution chain: open → build → root cause check → verify → archive. Hotfix provides default decisions for each phase: streamlined open, direct build, root cause confirmation, scale-based verification, and final archive confirmation after verification passes.

Before starting, locate Comet scripts via `comet/reference/scripts.md`. When resuming from any entry point, first use `comet/reference/context-recovery.md` to confirm phase/workflow.

When resuming an existing hotfix change, the first state operation must be `comet state select <change-name>`. For a new change, run the command immediately after `.comet.yaml` initialization and before source writes.

### 1. Quick Open (preset open)

Reuse Comet open capability to create change, but use hotfix defaults: do not execute `openspec-explore` long exploration, directly enter streamlined change creation.

**Immediately execute:** Use the Skill tool to load the `openspec-new-change` skill. Skipping this step is prohibited.

After the skill loads, create the change skeleton first, then immediately initialize recoverable state and bind the current change:

```bash
comet state init <name> hotfix
comet state select <name>
comet state check <name> open
```

If the `select` / `check` output is `BLOCKED` because `bound_branch` does not match the current branch, immediately pause under `comet/reference/decision-point.md` and let the user choose one option: switch back to the bound branch and rerun entry verification, or run `comet state rebind <change-name>` after the user explicitly confirms the current branch should take over this change, then rerun entry verification. Do not switch branches or rebind on your own.

Entry workspace isolation is a user decision point; do not use `current` as the default isolation mode. Pause under `comet/reference/decision-point.md` and let the user choose one option:

- A. Work directly on the current branch: run `comet state set <name> isolation current` to truthfully bind the current branch
- B. Create a branch: create and switch to `hotfix/YYYYMMDD/<change-name>`, then run `comet state set <name> isolation branch`
- C. Create a worktree: first use the Skill tool to load Superpowers `using-git-worktrees`; let that skill create the isolated workspace, then run `comet state set <name> isolation worktree` inside the worktree

After B/C, rerun this in the actual execution branch or worktree:

```bash
comet state select <name>
```

Then create the streamlined artifacts:
  - `proposal.md` — problem description + root cause analysis + fix goal (no solution comparison needed)
  - `design.md` — fix solution (one is enough, no multi-solution comparison needed)
  - `tasks.md` — fix task list
- **No delta spec needed** (unless fix changes existing spec acceptance scenarios)

Run phase guard to transition open → build:

```bash
comet guard <change-name> open --apply
```

Check `auto_transition` to decide whether to continue:

```bash
comet state next <name>
```

- `NEXT: auto` → continue to Step 2
- `NEXT: manual` → return control with `HINT` and end the current invocation; do not ask whether to continue

### 2. Direct Build (preset build)

Use hotfix defaults: `build_mode: direct`, `tdd_mode: direct`, and `review_mode: off`. `isolation` must keep the entry workspace isolation the user confirmed in Step 1; do not change it back to `current` on your own. Here `direct` skips full planning/TDD orchestration; it never skips reproduction, regression coverage, or verification. Skip Superpowers `brainstorming` and `writing-plans`; **task count alone does not route to `/comet-build`**. Keep larger task lists ordered in the current hotfix and ask about upgrading only when a qualitative-change signal or scope tripwire is hit.

Before continuing or starting changes, handle uncommitted changes through `comet/reference/dirty-worktree.md`. If attribution shows a qualitative-change signal or file-count tripwire is hit, handle it through this file's "Upgrade Assessment".

Before implementation, **reproduce the bug and record failing evidence first**:

1. Confirm the reported old behavior with minimal repeatable steps and record the command, input, and actual result
2. When automatable, add and run a regression test that fails for this bug; confirm the failure is caused by the bug rather than the environment or test itself
3. If automation is temporarily impossible, record why plus repeatable manual failing evidence in the proposal/verification report; never edit code without evidence

After RED evidence exists, execute tasks one by one according to tasks.md:

1. Read `openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md`, get incomplete task list
2. For each incomplete task:
   - Modify code according to task description
   - Run project formatter (e.g., `mvn spotless:apply`, `npm run format`)
   - First rerun the new failing regression test and confirm it turns green, then run related tests
   - Check corresponding `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in tasks.md
   - Commit code, commit message format: `fix: <brief fix description>`
3. After all tasks complete, explicitly run relevant project tests and build commands

**If fix affects existing spec acceptance scenarios**:
- Create delta spec in `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
- Only include `## MODIFIED Requirements` section

During hotfix execution, whenever a crash, unexpected behavior, test failure, or build failure appears while running the program, tests, build, or manual verification, must use the Skill tool to load the Superpowers `systematic-debugging` skill. Before root-cause investigation is complete, must not propose or implement source-code fixes.

For specific investigation, minimal failing test, fix verification, and keeping the current change verification loop, follow `comet/reference/debug-gate.md`.

### 3. Root Cause Elimination Check

**Execute before running build guard**, ensuring the fix actually eliminates the root cause:

1. Read bug description and root cause in proposal.md
2. Search and verify problem code no longer exists
3. If root cause not eliminated, return to Step 2 to continue fix (still in build phase, no state transition needed)

**Upgrade assessment signals**:
- Root cause check reveals deep architecture issues → Hits a qualitative-change signal; pause per the "Upgrade Assessment" section and let the user decide
- Fix requires additional interface changes → Hits a qualitative-change signal (introduces new public API); pause per the "Upgrade Assessment" section and let the user decide

After root cause is confirmed eliminated, run phase guard to transition build → verify:

```bash
comet guard <change-name> build --apply
```

State automatically updates to `phase: verify`, `verify_result: pending`, then enter verification.

### 4. Verification (preset verify)

Reuse `/comet-verify`, with comet-verify's scale assessment deciding lightweight or full verification.

**Immediately execute:** Use the Skill tool to load the `comet-verify` skill. Skipping this step is prohibited.

Small-scale hotfixes without delta spec usually meet lightweight verification conditions (≤ 3 tasks, changed files below the scale threshold), comet-verify's scale assessment will select the lightweight verification path (6 quick checks; default `review_mode: off` does not dispatch automatic code review). If the user wants to increase review, they can run `comet state set <name> review_mode standard` or `thorough` before verification. If hotfix created delta spec, enter full verification path according to comet-verify's scale assessment rules.

After verification passes, record `.comet.yaml` `verify_result` as `pass` according to `/comet-verify` rules, must not skip this status before archiving. After verification passes, still enter `/comet-archive`'s final archive confirmation; do not automatically run the archive script.

### 5. Archive (preset archive)

Reuse `/comet-archive`. Must satisfy `verify_result: pass` in `.comet.yaml` before archiving, and wait for `/comet-archive`'s final archive confirmation.

**Immediately execute:** Use the Skill tool to load the `comet-archive` skill to archive. Skipping this step is prohibited.
If there is delta spec, sync to main spec according to comet-archive rules, and handle associated Design Doc and Plan archiving annotations.

---

## Continuous Execution Mode

<IMPORTANT>
Hotfix workflow is **one-time continuous execution**. After invoking `/comet-hotfix`, agent must automatically advance through hotfix steps, without pausing to wait for user input mid-way.

Exception: when `.comet.yaml` has `auto_transition: false`, end the current invocation at each phase boundary and return control with `HINT`; the user may run the next phase later. This is a manual handoff, not a new confirmation point.

The following genuine user decisions still pause:

1. Encountering an upgrade-assessment signal (see "Upgrade Assessment" section). **Must use the current platform's available user input/confirmation mechanism to pause and wait for the user to explicitly choose**: continue the hotfix flow, or upgrade to the full `/comet-classic` workflow
2. Verify-phase acceptance of WARNING/SUGGESTION deviations, Spec drift handling, or strategy after the automatic repair limit; the first 3 clearly repairable failures close automatically
3. Final archive confirmation and the branch-handling decision after the archive commit

Execution order: quick open → direct build → root cause check → verification → archive → complete

After each step completes, immediately enter next step. Within each phase, must still call corresponding Comet/OpenSpec/Superpowers skill according to above requirements; if the called skill has its own user decision points, follow that skill's rules.
</IMPORTANT>

## Upgrade Assessment

Hotfix upgrade assessment only decides whether to move from the preset workflow to full; file count never upgrades automatically, and `comet state scale` only decides verification weight.

If `/comet-classic` passes an intent frame from the entry, hotfix must recheck `risk_signal` and escalation signals only before build: new capability, public API, schema change, cross-module coordination, or deep architecture work. When any signal matches, enter the existing escalation decision point; do not reimplement entry intent recognition.

Continuously check these qualitative-change signals: cross-module coordination, needing a new capability, database schema changes, introducing a new public API, or touching a deep architecture problem (in hotfix context this often surfaces during the root-cause elimination check). If any signal appears, the agent **must not self-upgrade or self-decide to continue**.

The file-count tripwire is only a prompt: when changed files exceed the hint threshold (for example > 4 files), ask the user whether to continue hotfix or upgrade full. More files do not necessarily mean qualitative change. A bug fix is usually focused on 1-3 files, so exceeding the threshold means the change surface is larger and is worth having the user confirm it still fits the preset scope.

When a qualitative-change signal or file-count tripwire is hit, **must pause under the `comet/reference/decision-point.md` protocol and wait for the user's explicit choice**. Do not directly enter `/comet-design`; do not automatically add a Design Doc.

After the user chooses upgrade (option B), use the legal state-machine upgrade channel, a single command that converts the preset workflow to full and rolls back to design:

```bash
comet state transition <name> preset-escalate
```

This command atomically sets `workflow`/`classic_profile` to `full`, rolls `phase` back to `design`, clears `design_doc`, and clears preset-only `build_mode`, `tdd_mode`, `review_mode`, `isolation`, and `verify_mode`. Then add the Design Doc on the current change: **immediately use the Skill tool to load the `comet-design` skill**. On entering build, run the full joint workflow-configuration decision again.

When the user chooses continue (option A), continue the hotfix workflow and record the user's reason for continuing.

---

## Exit Conditions

- Bug fixed, tests pass
- Change archived
- If spec changes, synced to main spec
- **Phase guard**: Before build → verify run `comet guard <change-name> build --apply`; before verify → archive follow `/comet-verify` and run `comet guard <change-name> verify --apply`

## Automatic Handoff to Next Phase

Follow `comet/reference/auto-transition.md`. Key command:

```bash
comet state next <name>
```

- `NEXT: auto` → invoke the skill pointed to by `SKILL` to continue hotfix workflow (`phase: build` returns `comet-hotfix`, `verify` returns `comet-verify`, `archive` returns `comet-archive`)
- `NEXT: manual` → do not invoke the next skill; return control with `HINT`, end the invocation, and do not create another confirmation point
- `NEXT: done` → workflow is complete, no further action needed
