**Comet is a resumable long-running task workflow and Skill platform for coding.**

It uses a unified cross-platform runtime to connect OpenSpec artifacts, Superpowers execution methodology, Skill creation, evaluation, and release into a closed-loop workflow. 

It allows you to use a toolchain to handle everything from requirements to archiving, combine any skill to make it like Comet, evolving your skills based on scientific **Rubric**, **Pass@k**, and **Pass^k** scoring.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **0.4.0-beta.1** — Comet has been upgraded to a pure Node runtime (no longer dependent on Bash/WSL) and brings three core capabilities: use `/comet-any` to combine **any** skill into a custom workflow, use `comet eval` to evaluate **any** skill and integrate it into the LangSmith system, and use `comet dashboard` to visualize each change in the browser.
>
> **0.3.9** — Review mode (`off|standard|thorough`) controls Build/Verify code review with project defaults; init/update now use optional dependency prompts, broader CLI i18n, stronger phase guards, and macOS executable bits.
>
> **0.3.8** — Adds Kimi Code support, safe multi-platform `comet uninstall`, extended subagent dispatch, shared progressive-loading references, update checks, and pre-commit formatting.
>
> **0.3.7** — Adds CodeGraph semantic indexing, Beta context compression, active context compression, token optimizations, `auto_transition`, phase guards, optional TDD, and safer archive/verification flow.
>
> See [NEWS.md](NEWS.md) for details.

> Combining OpenSpec and Superpowers is not Comet's ultimate goal. We hope to track long-running skills like these and find the Harness capabilities that enable stable execution of long-running skills. If you are interested in participating, you are welcome to contribute to our project or learn from our source code.

## Why Comet

- **The stable core for long-running tasks** — Comet's Classic Spec mode combines OpenSpec and Superpowers with a state
  machine, phase guards, and scripts that connect the full lifecycle. Agents can only do the work allowed in the current
  phase and can only exit after the phase work is complete. The core flow can advance automatically, with HITL only at
  moments that need your confirmation.
- **Resumable workflow and intelligent routing** — Comet uses intent recognition to route each task toward the path it
  needs. `/comet` remembers where a change stopped, supports zero-context recovery across devices, and removes the need
  to memorize long Skill command names: use `/comet` to advance or resume your work.
- **Skill platform** — Comet can author reusable Skill packages and use `/comet-any` to organize them into distributable
  Bundles, so Skills you create can be distributed to coding platforms with one command, much like `comet init`.
- **Eval platform** — Comet assesses your skills using scientific Rubric, Pass@k, and Pass^k scoring, ensuring skill evolution is based on scientific evidence rather than intuition. It supports integration with LangSmith assessments, bringing evaluation to real-world enterprise production environments. Its dual-agent architecture automates the assessment process in your production environment.

## Extremely low memory threshold

With Comet, you only need to remember two skills and one command, covering coding, creation, and evaluation with an extremely low barrier to entry：

- Use `/comet` for coding tasks
- Use `/comet-any` to compose any Skills
- Use `comet eval` to evaluate any Skill

## Comet 0.4.0 Baseline Comparison

The following charts are from 16 Comet workflow tasks, with 5 samples per treatment, comparing no Comet, Comet 0.3.9, and Comet 0.4.0.

The core observations were the differences in Pass@5, Pass^5, and Rubric scores. The baseline without Comet Skills only validated business behavior.

## From Industry-Frontier Practice

Many Comet capabilities have parallels in current industry practice. 

> To compare Comet with those patterns, see [Comet Docs](https://docs.comet.rpamis.com/zh/tech-blog/comet-vs-industry).

## What You Can Learn

- **How to reliably trigger nested Skills** — not by making an agent perform something that merely looks like a Skill
  trigger, such as writing files based on a Skill description, but by actually triggering the Skill. Comet invokes many
  OpenSpec and Superpowers capabilities, with trigger prompts refined through broad real-world practice.
- **How to make composed Skills advance through multiple phases automatically** — not through manual intervention. Aside
  from necessary user choices, Comet's five-phase flow can trigger core Skills automatically while the state machine keeps
  transitions reliable.
- **How to make a Spec lifecycle resumable** — Comet links OpenSpec change/spec artifacts with Superpowers design and
  plan documents, then records phase, execution mode, verification result, and archive status in each change's
  `.comet.yaml`, so an agent can continue after interruption instead of rereading documents and guessing progress.
- **How to turn doc synchronization from reminders into automation** — Comet scripts handoff, state updates, validation,
  and archive sync, reducing repeated prompts such as "remember to update the design doc" or "remember to archive the
  change."
- **How to design guard conditions that agents can execute** — phase exits do not rely on an agent saying "done." Scripts
  such as `comet-guard.mjs`, `comet-yaml-validate.mjs`, and `comet-state.mjs` check tasks, state fields, verification
  evidence, and archive conditions before the workflow advances.
- **How to distribute and install Skills across platforms** — Comet supports many AI coding platforms, project/global
  install scopes, Chinese/English Skill variants, and platform-specific directories such as Antigravity's different
  project/global paths.
- **How to turn scripts into agent workflow infrastructure** — Comet scripts handle hashes, YAML fields, state machines,
  and archive flow, showing how workflow control that is easy to scatter across prompts can become testable, reusable
  tooling.
- **How to evolve Skills through scientific evaluation** — Comet Eval supports structured rubric scoring plus Pass@k and
  Pass^k metrics, with both local and LangSmith evaluation paths for production use.
- **How to create Comet-like Skills intelligently** — `/comet-any` composes arbitrary Skills. You describe your Skill
  preferences, and the agent handles stability-related hooks, rules, scripts, and referenced Skill files for you.

```

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>comet eval [target]</code> — Evaluate Skills through the shared eval harness</summary>

`comet eval` answers a simple question: does this Skill actually work reliably on standard tasks?

The most common case is evaluating a Skill generated by `/comet-any`. Generated packages usually include
`comet/eval.yaml`; pass that file to `comet eval` first:

```bash
comet eval ./generated-skill/comet/eval.yaml --collect
comet eval ./generated-skill/comet/eval.yaml --html
```

The first command only performs discovery and preflight checks, confirming that the manifest, tasks, and dependency paths
can be found before any expensive evaluation work runs. The second command runs local evaluation and writes a browsable
report suitable for publish-readiness evidence. The report path is printed by the command and is usually under
`eval/local/logs/experiments/<experiment-id>/summary.html`.

If you do not have `comet/eval.yaml` yet and only have a local Skill directory, start with a low-cost smoke run:

```bash
comet eval ./my-skill --quick --html
```

That path is useful early on: it checks that the Skill directory can be read, injected into the eval harness, and run
against the generic smoke task. For release evidence, prefer generating `comet/eval.yaml` through `/comet-any` and using
the manifest path.

### Reading Local Eval

Local eval is the normal path for day-to-day development and pre-release checks. In the HTML report, look first at:

- whether pass/fail and rubric scores match expectations
- whether failures are attributed to the Skill, workflow, task, model, or environment/harness
- whether expected artifacts are missing
- whether token use, cost, or duration look unusual
- whether the result is clean enough, or a specific task/treatment should be rerun

If the report says `Insufficient clean data` or `Inconclusive due to data quality`, check auth, rate limits,
Docker/container setup, network, and other environment issues before treating the run as a Skill-quality verdict.

### LangSmith Eval

Use the LangSmith suite when you want to sync eval results to LangSmith, or when your team wants to inspect runs, rubric
feedback, costs, and Claude Code trajectories together. It reuses the same tasks, treatments, rubric, and
`comet/eval.yaml`; the difference is that results are uploaded to LangSmith.

Prepare dependencies and environment variables once:

```bash
cd eval
uv sync --extra langsmith
```

```bash
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_pt_...
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=comet-skill-eval
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
```

Then run the same manifest:

```bash
cd eval
uv run pytest langsmith/tests/tasks/test_tasks.py \
  --eval-manifest=/absolute/path/to/generated-skill/comet/eval.yaml -v
```

In PowerShell, set `$env:LANGSMITH_API_KEY`, `$env:LANGSMITH_PROJECT`, and `$env:LANGSMITH_TRACING`, or place them in
`eval/.env`. See [eval/langsmith/README.md](eval/langsmith/README.md) for plugin cache and trajectory tracing details.

### Which Path To Use

- Day-to-day development: `comet eval ./my-skill --quick --html`
- `/comet-any` output: `comet eval ./generated-skill/comet/eval.yaml --collect`, then rerun with `--html`
- Publish evidence: prefer the local HTML report from `comet/eval.yaml`
- Team tracing and side-by-side comparison: run the same `comet/eval.yaml` through the LangSmith suite

For full task, treatment, report, and troubleshooting details, see the [Eval usage guide](docs/operations/EVAL-USAGE.md).

<details>
<summary><code>/comet-any</code> / <code>comet creator</code> / <code>comet publish</code> — Create, evaluate, and publish Skills</summary>

`/comet-any` is the main user path: Create or optimize a reusable Skill → validate it with `comet eval` → review and
distribute it, until it becomes a stable composed Skill. For resume and release, use `comet creator`,
`comet creator status` / `comet creator next`, `comet publish`, and `comet publish distribute --preview`. The README
does not expand the backend command list; see the [Skill creation guide](docs/operations/SKILL-CREATION.md) for Advanced Bundle backend and Advanced Engine Run details, including `comet skill run` / `comet skill continue`.

| `comet-state.mjs`         | Unified state management — init/set/get/check/scale, agents' exclusive YAML interface                      |
| `comet-hook-guard.mjs`    | Phase write guard — PreToolUse hook, blocks file writes during open/design/archive phases                  |

Classic automation ships as independent Node.js command scripts generated from TypeScript. They run through `node`
on every platform, so Comet requires only Node.js — no Bash, Git Bash, or WSL.

## Workflow

```
/comet
  ↓ auto-detect
/comet-open  -->  /comet-design  -->  /comet-build  -->  /comet-verify  -->  /comet-archive
(OpenSpec)         (Superpowers)       (Superpowers)       (Both)           (OpenSpec)

/comet-hotfix (preset path, skips brainstorming)
  open  -->  build  -->  verify  -->  archive

/comet-tweak (lightweight preset, chains OpenSpec)
  open  -->  build  -->  verify  -->  archive
```

### Five Phases

| Phase              | Command          | Owner       | Artifacts                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1. Open            | `/comet-open`    | OpenSpec    | proposal.md, design.md, tasks.md     |
| 2. Deep Design     | `/comet-design`  | Superpowers | Design Doc, delta spec               |
| 3. Plan & Build    | `/comet-build`   | Superpowers | Implementation plan, code commits    |
| 4. Verify & Finish | `/comet-verify`  | Both        | Verification report, branch handling |
| 5. Archive         | `/comet-archive` | OpenSpec    | delta→main spec sync, archive        |

### State Management

Comet uses a decoupled state architecture with separate files

<details>
<summary>View State Management</summary>

| File                                      | Owner    | Purpose                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `.openspec.yaml`                          | OpenSpec | Spec lifecycle, change metadata                     |
| `openspec/changes/<name>/.comet.yaml`     | Comet    | Workflow phase, execution mode, verification status |
| `.comet/run-state.json`                   | Engine   | Run identity and execution state (machine-owned)    |
| `.comet/state-events.jsonl`               | Comet    | Append-only state transition audit log              |

Each change-level `.comet.yaml` stores Classic workflow state and only keeps `run_id` as the link to the Engine Run.
Machine-owned Engine state lives in the change's `.comet/run-state.json` with camelCase fields such as `currentStep`,
`status`, and `iteration`. Legacy Run fields left in YAML are migrated after compatibility reads, and `skill` is no
longer a valid current `.comet.yaml` field. Project defaults live in `.comet/config.yaml`.

Phase progression is handled consistently by the TypeScript transition table, `comet-state transition`,
`comet-guard --apply`, and archive commands. Each successful progression appends an audit event to
`.comet/state-events.jsonl` with the source, before/after state, and actual field changes.

This keeps Skill text focused on guiding the agent while scripts own state writes, phase checks, auditability, and
breakpoint recovery. Agents can use Comet commands to know which phase the current Spec is in.

Current change `.comet.yaml` no longer contains `skill`; legacy Run fields in YAML are migrated to `.comet/run-state.json`.

### Reliability Features

Comet ensures agent execution reliability through automated state transitions:

<details>
<summary>View reliability features</summary>

1. **Entry Verification** — Each phase validates preconditions before execution
   - Checks file existence, state consistency, and phase transitions
   - Outputs `[HARD STOP]` with actionable suggestions if validation fails

2. **Automated State Transitions** — `comet-guard.mjs --apply` updates `.comet.yaml` automatically
   - All phase transitions (open → design/build → verify → archive) use `guard --apply`
   - No manual state editing required — eliminates write-verification errors
   - `comet-state.mjs` is the agents' exclusive interface for state operations
   - Guard and archive scripts use `comet-state.mjs` internally for state management

3. **Schema Validation** — `comet-yaml-validate.mjs` ensures data integrity
   - Validates required and optional fields
   - Validates enum values, including `direct_override`
   - Validates `design_doc`, `plan`, and `handoff_context` paths exist, plus `handoff_hash` format
   - Detects unknown/typos fields

4. **Build Decision Enforcement** — Guard and state transitions both block skipped build choices
   - `isolation` must be `branch` or `worktree`
   - `build_mode` must be selected before leaving build
   - `build_pause: plan-ready` is a recoverable pause after plan generation, not a `build_mode`
   - Full workflow `build_mode: direct` requires `direct_override: true`

5. **Verification Evidence** — Guard enforces proof before phase advance
   - `verify-pass` transition requires `verification_report` pointing to an existing report file
   - `branch_status` must be `handled` before verify can pass
   - Guard checks `verification_report exists` and `branch_status=handled` as hard prerequisites
   - Prevents false phase advances when verification or branch handling was skipped

6. **Archive Automation** — `comet-archive.mjs` handles the full archive flow in one command
   - Validates entry state, merges delta specs into main specs through OpenSpec
   - Annotates design doc and plan frontmatter
   - Moves change to archive directory and updates `archived: true`
   - Supports `--dry-run` for preview

7. **Anti-drift Phase Guards** — Phase awareness for long-context sessions
   - Rule layer: `comet-phase-guard.md` injects phase awareness, Skill invocation rules, and context recovery guidance
     each turn across platforms
   - Hook layer: `comet-hook-guard.mjs` hard-blocks file writes during open/design/archive phases on platforms that
     support hooks, such as Claude Code
   - Allowlisted paths: `openspec/*`, `docs/superpowers/*`, `.superpowers/*`, `.claude/*`, and `.comet/*`

<details>
<summary>Context Compression (Beta)</summary>

Comet supports context compression at the Design → Build handoff. When enabled, `comet-handoff.mjs` generates a compact
context package that reduces Build-phase input tokens by **25–30%** without affecting implementation correctness.

| Mode   | Behavior                                 | Token Savings |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `off`  | Full Spec excerpts in handoff context    | Baseline      |
| `beta` | Design Doc + SHA256 hash references only | ~25–30%       |

Key findings from benchmark testing:

- **Test pass rate**: 100% across all tiers (compression does not affect correctness)
- **Spec coverage**: 100% (off) vs 95% (beta) — minor edge-case detail loss
- **Scaling**: Larger tasks yield higher absolute savings (up to 15,000 tokens for large-tier tasks)

Enable in `.comet/config.yaml`: `context_compression: beta`

See [CONTEXT-COMPRESSION.md](docs/CONTEXT-COMPRESSION.md) for the full benchmark report, compression principles, and
reproduction steps.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Auto Transition</summary>

`auto_transition` controls whether Comet automatically invokes the next skill after a phase completes, or pauses for
manual handoff. Phase advancement itself always happens — this setting only affects skill invocation.

| Value   | Behavior                                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `true`  | Auto-invoke the next skill after each phase (default)         |
| `false` | Pause after each phase; user manually triggers the next skill |

Three-layer configuration with precedence: `COMET_AUTO_TRANSITION` env var > `.comet/config.yaml` (project) > change
`.comet.yaml`.

See [AUTO-TRANSITION.md](docs/AUTO-TRANSITION.md) for configuration details, workflow mapping, and FAQ.
